I need to know how to use react code which is generate for an animation, and turn it into a mp4 video file using node.js.
I need a complete setup where I just add the code into a predefined directory structure and then I run scripts which will convert it to mp4 video format.
I also need this fully documented in a user guide which describes how to get this done step by step.
