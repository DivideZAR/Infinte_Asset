# Infinte_Asset Project TODO

This file tracks project-wide tasks and their completion status.

## Format

Each task is represented as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "task-id",
  "content": "Task description",
  "status": "pending|in_progress|completed|cancelled",
  "priority": "high|medium|low"
}
```

## Status Values

- `pending`: Task not yet started
- `in_progress`: Task currently being worked on
- `completed`: Task successfully completed
- `cancelled`: Task was cancelled or no longer needed

## Priority Values

- `high`: Critical or blocking task
- `medium`: Important but not blocking
- `low`: Nice to have, can wait

## Current Tasks

### Completed Tasks ✓

- ✅ Fix ESLint configuration - change .eslintrc.js from ES module exports to CommonJS (lines 1 and 96)
- ✅ Install ts-jest dependency to fix Jest configuration
- ✅ Create test fixtures directory with valid-animation and test-animation
- ✅ Fix TypeScript configuration - exclude animation subprojects from root tsconfig
- ✅ Create TypeScript declaration file for animations/Scene1/src/App.jsx
- ✅ Fix build structure - create src/index.ts or update tsconfig to match current structure
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/convert.ts (import.meta, inputFormat, unused vars, implicit any types)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/dev-server.ts (import.meta, unused imports, return types)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/stages/browser-renderer.ts (unused vars, window.animationReady)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/stages/html-generator.ts (implicit any types, missing properties)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/stages/video-encoder.ts (fluent-ffmpeg types, any types, progress handling)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/validate.ts (import.meta, unused vars)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/tailwind-converter.ts (import.meta, duplicate properties, unused vars)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in scripts/stages/pipeline.ts (import.meta, unused imports)
- ✅ Fix ESLint errors and warnings in scripts directory
- ✅ Run final verification - ensure npm run lint, test, typecheck, build all pass
- ✅ Fix Jest configuration for proper module resolution (ESM support)
- ✅ Create `git-agent` global CLI wrapper for Git_Agent
- ✅ Implement frame-by-frame synchronization: Sync browser capture loop with animation `requestAnimationFrame`
- ✅ Refactor `html-generator.ts`: Replace fragile Regex-based `stripExports` with AST-based parsing (TypeScript API)
- ✅ Remove runtime CDN dependencies: Bundle React/ReactDOM locally and pre-compile JSX for offline conversion
- ✅ Optimize frame capture: Investigate `canvas.toDataURL()` or `MediaStream` API to replace slow screenshot capturing
- ✅ Document architecture: Create diagrams/docs for the `Git_Agent`, `Tester_Agent`, and Conversion Pipeline interactions
- ✅ Fix Capture Loop Precision: Remove arbitrary 500ms fast-forward and clean up unused console logs
- ✅ Enhance AST Transformation: Support default/namespace imports for React and improve component name detection
- ✅ Improve Cleanup Logic: Ensure temp directories are always removed, even on early failure
- ✅ Canvas Optimization Safety: Handle multiple canvases correctly
- ✅ Add Three.js support and conditional injection based on 3D detection
- ✅ Fix Three.js template replacement bug: Prevent replacement of {THREE_SOURCE} inside library code
- ✅ Add "Particle Burst" 2D animation for comprehensive testing
- ✅ Add AI prompt template to project documentation
  - README.md updated with clear 🎯 emoji markers
  - Easy to identify start/end for AI prompt copying
  - Includes all constraints and guidelines
- ✅ Check with git agent to maintain best practices
- ✅ Update project todo.md
- ✅ Update AGENTS.md to be more concise and accurate (167 lines, reduced from 220)
- ✅ Improve smoothness of MP4 files generated from 3D React animations
  - Implemented frame-deterministic rendering (eliminates flickering)
  - Fixed Playwright #37635 RAF/clock sync issue
  - Added explicit renderFrame() function for frame-based control
  - Removed continuous requestAnimationFrame loops
  - Updated browser-renderer.ts to call renderFrame() explicitly
  - Test: test-3d now renders at 60fps smoothly (0.11 MB, 180 frames)
  - See: output/test-3d-smooth.mp4
  - Applied fix to html-generator to restrict frame-based rendering to Three.js only
  - 2D animations (pulse-circles, example-animation) use continuous RAF
  - Successfully tested multiple animations at 60fps
- ✅ Investigate white screen issue in output files
  - Root cause: HTML template replacement breaking Scene1 animation
  - Scene1 code had '{REACT_SOURCE}' strings (intentional or accidental)
  - html-generator.ts replaced ALL occurrences, including those in user code
  - This caused minified React library code to have syntax errors
  - Fix: Use unique placeholders '@@REACT_SOURCE@@' and '@@REACT_DOM_SOURCE@@'
  - Results: Scene1 now renders correctly (180 frames, 60fps, no errors)
  - White screen issue RESOLVED
- ✅ Fix white screen issue - COMPLETED
  - Fixed template placeholders in html-generator.ts
  - Added Three.js WebGL renderer capture support
  - Added RGB24 pixel format for FFmpeg encoding
  - Canvas detection now supports both 2D and WebGL renderers
- ✅ Add Three.js WebGL renderer capture support
  - Browser renderer now detects WebGL renderers via getContext('webgl')
  - Three.js scenes (NewScene1_fixed) now properly captured
  - Both 2D canvas and WebGL canvas detection implemented

### In Progress

- [ ] Fix NewScene1_fixed animation rendering
  - Three.js capture now working (WebGL renderer support added)
  - Animation has syntax issues preventing proper frame rendering
  - Needs debugging or recreation with simpler implementation

### Pending Tasks

#### High Priority

(No high priority tasks currently pending)

#### Medium Priority

(No medium priority tasks currently pending)

#### Low Priority

(No low priority tasks currently pending)

## Notes

### Infrastructure Status

- ✅ ESLint: Working (animations ignored, some environmental resolution issues exist but code is valid)
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors (all script files fixed)
- ✅ Build: Working (dist/ created successfully)
- ✅ Jest: Working (all tests passing with ESM support)
- ✅ CLI: `git-agent` and `tester` (via scripts/tester.js) are operational

### Known Issues

1. Git_Agent Created
   - Comprehensive git operations subagent at scripts/Git_Agent.js
   - Now accessible globally via `git-agent` command

2. Tester_Agent Created
   - Comprehensive testing subagent at scripts/Tester_Agent.js
   - Can run typecheck, lint, tests, build
   - Integrates with todo tracking

## How to Update Tasks

### Using Tester_Agent

```bash
# Show current todos
node scripts/tester.js show-todos

# Mark task as in progress
# (Need to implement)
```
